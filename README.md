# Spring_Employee_Payroll_App_Development
Create a Employee Payroll Spring Project to cater to REST Request from Employee Payroll UI - Here we will reuse the Employee Payroll Frontend UI we have already developed - Instead of making REST call to JSONServer will now make server calls to Employee Payroll Spring App - Also test the REST API using CURL Commands
